# Tests

This repository uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) together with
[JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) to run browser-style tests in Node.

## Install dependencies

From the repository root, install the Node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run all tests

Execute the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

This command runs every `*.test.js` file inside the `tests/` directory.
