## Find and Replace (Docs/Word)

Here's how you can find and convert citation-style numbers in brackets (e.g., [1], [13]) into superscript numbers in Microsoft Word using Find and Replace: 


Find (wildcards on):
```
\[([0-9]{1,3})\]
```

Replace with (change font/format to superscript):
```
^&
```
